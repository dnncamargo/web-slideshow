# PowerShow Roadmap

This document records the **PowerShow execution path from the canonical-document foundation to the current work area**.

Merged code in `main` remains authoritative. Every new work area begins by revalidating the real repository state.

## Status legend

- ✅ complete / merged
- 🟡 useful operational base complete; future expansion exists
- ← NEXT current planned execution area
- planned future checkpoint
- deferred intentional backlog/future work

## Execution policy

PowerShow uses audit-first, checkpoint-driven development:

```text
AUDIT current code
→ collect EVIDENCE
→ freeze the smallest DECISION
→ IMPLEMENT narrowly
→ TEST
→ inspect the real remote SHA / diff / files
→ manual acceptance when visual/runtime behavior requires it
→ PR / merge
→ return local repository to updated main
```

Core rules:

- `schemaVersion` stays literally `1`;
- no migration, dual schema, compatibility layer or generic abstraction without a concrete requirement;
- current code in `main` is the first authority for implementation details;
- tests are contractual evidence but do not replace manual visual/runtime acceptance when acceptance is required;
- search/reuse existing ownership before creating another state, protocol or abstraction;
- branch names and historical SHAs are evidence only — always fetch and revalidate;
- completed architecture should not be reopened speculatively.

### Post-merge closure — mandatory

After every PR + merge:

```text
git fetch origin --prune
git switch main
git pull --ff-only origin main
```

Then verify:

```text
branch == main
HEAD == origin/main
worktree clean
```

Do not begin a new work area or create a new feature branch from a stale local `main`. If fetch/switch/pull fails or the worktree is unexpectedly dirty, stop and report instead of repairing history automatically.

# P0–P8 — Foundation history ✅

## P0 — Canonical document foundation ✅

Reference: PR #2.

Established strict `@powershow/document-schema`, recursive semantic elements, runtime validation and `schemaVersion: 1`.

## P1 — Renderer and Player foundation ✅

References: PRs #3–#5.

Established the shared rendering boundary:

```text
canonical Presentation
→ shared renderer
→ Studio preview / Player runtime
```

## P2 — Studio Editor V0 ✅

References: PRs #6–#13.

Delivered the first visual authoring shell, slide CRUD/navigation, recursive element selection/update, inspectors, presets and localization.

## P3 — Visual authoring vocabulary ✅

References: PRs #14–#29.

Expanded typography, gradients, fonts, reusable colors, Image sizing and style authoring.

## P4 — Hierarchy, positioning and Canvas authoring ✅

References: PRs #30–#38.

Delivered Container Flow/Stack, hierarchy operations, Canvas move/resize, Image proportional resize and focal authoring.

Canonical placement after later cleanup:

```text
Flow
→ no authored layout.position

Absolute
→ layout.position: "absolute"
→ direct top/right/bottom/left edges
```

## P5 — Firebase persistence, Library and autosave ✅

References: PRs #39–#41.

Established user-scoped Firestore drafts, Library workflows, repository-backed Editor loading and debounced/explicit save.

## P6 — Immutable publishing ✅

Reference: PR #42.

Existing published versions are immutable.

## P7 — Authentication, public pointer and remote-control base ✅

References: PRs #43–#44.

Delivered Studio authentication, public publication pointer, Control boundary and RTDB remote-navigation base.

## P8 — Live activation and Library entry ✅

References: PRs #45–#46.

Established Library Present / Control / End lifecycle. Publish and Present remain separate operations.

---

# P9 — Live presentation foundation ✅

References: PRs #47–#57 and later hardening.

Delivered Player live entry, immutable-version loading, logical `pageId` navigation, Control desired state, Player applied state / ACK, latency evidence, reconnect convergence, staged publication promotion, private Notes and Watch following actual Player-applied state.

Core flow:

```text
Control desired state
→ RTDB
→ Player applies immutable published state
→ Player applied state / ACK
→ Control + Watch observe convergence
```

# P10 — Canonical Authoring & Import Foundation ✅

| Checkpoint | Area | Status | Main references |
|---|---|---:|---|
| P10.1 | Typography & Fonts refinement | ✅ | #58–#59 |
| P10.2 | Links / Interaction | ✅ | #60–#62 |
| P10.3 | ContentSlot foundation | ✅ | #63 |
| P10.4 | Topics | ✅ | #64–#66 |
| P10.5 | Structured Table | ✅ | #73 |
| P10.6 | Inline Text / Rich Text foundation | ✅ | #74 |
| P10.7 | Gallery minimum | ✅ | #75 |
| P10.8 | Embed minimum | ✅ | #76 |
| P10.9 | Blocks + Code semantics | ✅ | #77–#78 |
| P10.10 | Scripted minimum | ✅ | #79 |
| P10.11 | Canonical Contract Cleanup | ✅ | #80–#83 |
| P10.12 | JSON Import / Export | ✅ | #84 |

Permanent P10 invariants include:

- `schemaVersion` remains `1`;
- strict responsibility-specific contracts;
- no universal persisted style bag;
- Player independent of Studio-private resources;
- `textbox` is not canonical; boxed text is `Container + Text`;
- import/export operates directly on the canonical Presentation.

---

# P11 — Resources, Organization & Text Styles ✅

References: PRs #69–#71, #85–#105, with later refinement in PRs #125 and #129.

Delivered shared Studio/Library shell, private folders, Custom Library resources, Presentation-local Palette/FontResources/Text Styles, Linked Styles, refined usage/navigation and compact shared resource actions.

Text Style precedence:

```text
Theme role baseline
→ Text Style
→ local Text override
```

Linked Style precedence:

```text
Theme / defaults
→ Linked Style
→ local Container override
```

---

# P12 — UX / Properties refinement ✅

Delivered shared logical slide geometry, Player/Editor/Presenter/Watch geometry convergence, Palette/gradient corrections, Container overflow/Fit/Preserve size, Image inspector refinements, Delete→Enter confirmation and related authoring polish.

Direct Canvas manipulation inside transformed fitted Containers remains deferred until inverse transformed-authoring geometry is deliberately implemented.

---

# Runtime and product surfaces ✅

```text
PowerShow
│
├── Public Portal        /
├── Studio
│   ├── Library          /studio/library
│   ├── Editor           /studio/editor
│   └── Control          /studio/control
│       └── Maintenance  /studio/control/maintenance
└── Live Runtime
    ├── Player
    └── Watch
```

Canonical product names are PowerShow Library, PowerShow Editor, PowerShow Control, PowerShow Player and PowerShow Watch.

Public Portal / Live Cover is complete; Cover remains static/read-only while Watch follows real Player state.

---

# Gallery V1 ✅

References: PRs #114–#115.

Gallery is one semantic media frame with ordered items. Studio, Player local behavior and one-way Control commands through `live/galleryControl/<slot>` are complete.

---

# Maintenance & Diagnostics — first operational slice ✅

References: PRs #116–#119, #121, Suite-chrome PR #127 and later Player-logs work in PR #134.

Delivered:

- Player presence/current report and boot-scoped leases;
- Control/Maintenance status evidence;
- remote reload;
- same-boot presentation retry;
- real browser-cache clear path;
- Player-local recovery options;
- Maintenance under PowerShow Control;
- remote activation-scoped Player logs mode for already-open Players.

Diagnostics remains bounded. Do not turn it into a generic fleet/admin console or broad automatic repair system.

---

# Persistence serialization hardening ✅

Reference: PR #120.

Firestore persists canonical Presentation content as `presentationJson`, parsed and validated through `PresentationSchema` on read.

---

# Blocks — grammar-based didactic visual authoring ✅

References: PRs #122–#123.

Canonical Blocks persists a single `source` string. A handwritten parser creates transient structure for shared static rendering. Blocks is static/didactic, not executable.

---

# Editor Resource Controls polish ✅

Reference: PR #129.

Merged Preserve size grammar, compact Add/Apply actions, projected Text Styles count and related resource-control polish.

---

# Scripted controlled interaction ✅

Reference: PR #133.

Scripted enhancement is complete and no longer the active queue.

Delivered:

- declared action ports;
- declared boolean and number state ports;
- `input`, `output` and `input-output` direction where applicable;
- Player-owned transient runtime identity;
- strict Player↔sandbox message validation;
- Scripted-specific RTDB input/runtime/report state;
- Control stateful controls generated from declarations;
- desired/reported/pending/divergent semantics;
- retained renderer-owned sandbox and fixed CSP boundary.

Permanent constraints remain:

- no `allow-same-origin` for Scripted;
- no Firebase SDK/tokens/session exposure inside authored code;
- no parent DOM access;
- no top navigation/forms/popups/downloads/storage;
- no `eval` / `Function`;
- no JavaScript payload delivered through RTDB;
- runtime state never persists into the Presentation.

---

# Player presentation options + remote logs ✅

Reference: PR #134.

Delivered:

- slide transition: Fade / Slide / None;
- Player control position;
- Player control style;
- counter On / Off;
- control-bar animation;
- activation-scoped `live/slideTransition`;
- activation-scoped `live/playerControls`;
- activation-scoped `live/playerLogs`;
- Maintenance connected-Player discovery from boot-scoped leases;
- remote logs On/Off without sending arbitrary Player URLs through RTDB.

RTDB rules for these contracts were validated and explicitly deployed.

---

# Mobile Library / Control recovery ✅

Current `main` recovers the previously accepted mobile Library and Control behavior after PR #134.

Current rule:

- compact Player Settings is desktop-only;
- Previous, Next, Fullscreen and End remain part of mobile Control;
- responsive ownership stays in layout/CSS rather than user-agent detection.

An iPhone 14 Plus is a concrete mobile acceptance device in the current workflow, but breakpoint changes remain evidence-driven.

---

# Terminal + Code + Table typography/layout refinement ← NEXT

The next work area is refinement of existing canonical elements, not element creation.

Primary goal: improve typography and layout behavior for `terminal`, `code` and `table` while preserving shared-renderer convergence and avoiding duplicate style contracts.

## TCL0 — real-system audit

Before implementation, audit the current real `main` for:

- canonical schemas/defaults for Terminal, Code and Table;
- renderer ownership and current CSS/classes;
- Inspector controls and effective defaults;
- current typography responsibilities versus shared Text/Typography infrastructure;
- layout/overflow/size responsibilities;
- theme defaults and any element-specific styling;
- Studio preview, Player and Watch parity;
- current tests and visual regressions.

The audit must identify which refinements belong to:

```text
existing canonical property
existing shared typography/layout property
renderer-only presentation default
Inspector ergonomics
```

Do not add a generic typography namespace or new compatibility layer merely because three elements need similar controls.

## Planned checkpoints

```text
TCL0 — audit Terminal / Code / Table real ownership
TCL1 — freeze smallest typography/layout responsibility changes
TCL2 — Terminal + Code refinement
TCL3 — Table refinement
TCL4 — shared-renderer regressions + manual visual acceptance when available
```

Checkpoint boundaries may be reduced further after TCL0 evidence.

---

# Chart V1 — NEXT AFTER TERMINAL/CODE/TABLE

Chart is now explicitly promoted from deferred work.

Current baseline before audit: Chart already exists canonically as semantic data for `line`, `bar`, `area` and `scatter`, while rendering remains placeholder/minimum.

## C0 — real-system audit

Before selecting a charting library or changing the contract, audit:

- exact current `ChartElement` schema/defaults;
- current renderer placeholder and styling ownership;
- current Studio Inspector/authoring support;
- data-series/category/value semantics;
- palette/typography/layout interaction;
- resize/aspect/overflow expectations;
- Player/Watch/shared-renderer requirements;
- bundle/performance constraints;
- whether a dependency is actually necessary;
- existing tests and import/export behavior.

Do not choose a chart library first and then reshape the canonical contract around it.

## Planned checkpoints

```text
C0 — audit canonical Chart + renderer + authoring
C1 — freeze Chart V1 rendering/authoring responsibilities
C2 — shared renderer implementation
C3 — Studio authoring refinement
C4 — Player/Watch/import-export regression + visual acceptance
```

Keep Chart semantic and provider/library-neutral at the canonical layer.

---

# Future / deferred

## Embed adjustments — future as promoted

Embed exists canonically. Resume only from a concrete provider/runtime audit. Do not expose authored sandbox/Permissions Policy internals merely for convenience.

## publishNow — deferred

The proposed fast-live Editor mode remains intentionally paused.

## Topics consuming Typography Styles — deferred concept

Topics currently owns its typography context; future direct Typography Style consumption is not frozen.

## P13 — Production Readiness — planned

Promote from concrete deployment/reliability needs: Studio→publish→Control→Player E2E, auth/rules review, deploy/smoke/rollback, constrained-hardware performance, responsive acceptance and security review.

## P14 — Maintenance & Diagnostics 🟡

D0–D2 plus remote logs are operational. Further expansion remains evidence-driven and bounded.

## P15 — Audience / Watch expansion — future

Watch already follows Player-applied state. Viewer presence/count/nickname and richer audience behavior remain future candidates and must never grant audience clients shared presentation control.

Other future candidates include bounded Undo/Redo, AI Import into the existing canonical Presentation, Player offline continuity, Custom Library portability refinements and remaining WYSIWYG/Text improvements.

NEXT:
  Terminal + Code + Table typography/layout refinement — begin with TCL0 audit

THEN:
  Chart V1 — begin with C0 audit

DEFERRED / FUTURE:
  Embed adjustments
  publishNow
  Topics → Typography Style consumer concept
  Production Readiness
  Audience / Watch expansion
```

The next implementation session must begin by completing post-merge local closure, auditing the **real current `main`**, and then performing TCL0 before freezing any new typography/layout contract.
